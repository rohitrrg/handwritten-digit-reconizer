## Requirements:
* Python3
* scikit-learn
* numpy
* pandas
* cv2
* matplotlib
* Flask

## Dataset: 
https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data <br>
The data files train.csv and test.csv contain gray-scale images of hand-drawn digits, from zero through nine.

Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total. Each pixel has a single pixel-value associated with it, indicating the lightness or darkness of that pixel, with higher numbers meaning darker. This pixel-value is an integer between 0 and 255, inclusive.


## Accuracy using machine learning algorithms
* K-Nearest Neighbors: 96.67%
* Decision Tree : 
* Random Forest : 
* XGB Classifier:
